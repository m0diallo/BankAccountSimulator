# Bank Account Simulator

This project is a simple bank account simulator written in Swift. It consists of two main components: `VirtualBankSystem` and `BankAccount`, which together simulate basic banking operations.

## VirtualBankSystem
`VirtualBankSystem` is a class that allows customers to interact with the bank system. It provides the following functionality:
- Welcoming customers to the virtual bank system.
- Guiding customers through the account opening process, including choosing between a debit or credit account.
- Creating and managing bank accounts.
- Performing money transfer operations (withdraw or deposit) on the selected bank account.
- Checking and displaying the account balance based on the account type.

## BankAccount
`BankAccount` is a struct representing a customer's bank account. It has the following features:
- Separate balances for debit and credit accounts.
- A credit limit for credit accounts.
- Methods to deposit and withdraw money from both debit and credit accounts.

## Getting Started
To run this bank account simulator, you can simply execute the provided code. It creates a virtual bank system, guides customers through the account opening process, and performs various banking operations. It demonstrates how customers can interact with their accounts.

## Usage
This simulator can serve as a starting point for more complex banking applications or as an educational tool to help users understand basic banking operations. Feel free to expand upon this project to include more features and functionality.
