<h1>Bank Account Simulator Project</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project is a hands-on journey into the world of Swift programming where I built a comprehensive bank account simulator. It's designed to be a practical exercise that not only reinforces my understanding of fundamental programming concepts but also showcases my ability to create a functional application using Swift.
<br />


<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Language: Swift</b> 

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Xcode</b> (iOS 17.0.1)

<h2>What to Expect:</h2>

<p>
In this project, I delved into the core of Swift development, working with various programming constructs to create a fully functional bank account simulator. Here's a glimpse of what the project entailed:

- <b>Fundamental Programming Constructs:</b> I utilized functions, loops, conditional statements, switch statements, structures, and classes to build the bank account simulator's functionality.
- <b>Logical Structure:</b> The bank account simulator's operations were implemented using functions, and these were thoughtfully organized within the project's structure. This approach enhances code readability and maintainability.
- <b>User Input Handling:</b> The project incorporated loops to efficiently process user input and create valid bank accounts. Conditional statements and switch statements were strategically used to ensure that the simulator's operations run smoothly.
</p>

<h2>Key Objectives:</h2>

<p>

- Create Valid Bank Accounts: I designed the simulator to create valid bank accounts by defining the necessary attributes and conditions for each account type.
  
- Check Bank Account Balance: The simulator allows users to check the balance of their bank accounts accurately.

- Validate Withdrawals and Deposits: I implemented comprehensive logic to ensure the validity of withdrawals from and deposits to bank accounts.

  Ultimately, I coded a bank account simulator that not only creates valid bank accounts but also manages them effectively. I configured the simulator to check account balances, validate transactions, and monitor deposits â€“ all with the appropriate programming logic. </p>
